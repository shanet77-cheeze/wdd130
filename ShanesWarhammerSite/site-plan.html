      <h3>CHOOSE YOUR FACTION | Dive into the lore of 40K</h3>
      <p>
        There are many factions to choose from in Warhammer 40,000. Each with their own unique abilities, characteristics, and allegiances. There is a faction out there that will resonate uniquely with you. The main factions of Warhammer 40k are these three:

        The Imperium of Man: Humanity of the 41st Millenium. Humanity spans thousands of planets across the galaxy, worshiping the God Emperor of Mankind. The powerful leader of humanity who has sat in his throne slowly dying for the past 10,000 years after being wounded by his traitor son. Humanity fights fiercely against all perceived threats. Their forces range from normal human foot soldiers fighting in the trenches for their Emperor, to powerful cybernetic and magically enhanced human warriors who slay the most dangerous threats to humanity. The signature characters of the Imperium are the Space Marines, the poster boys of 40k.

Xenos: the alien races that occupy the galaxy. Most of which want to conquer and or exterminate humanity. Featuring armies such as the Tyranids, a species of deadly alien creatures all united by one hivemind. The Tyranids live to consume organic matter and evolve themselves to be deadlier and more efficient killing machines. The Orks: big brutes with clubs and axes straight out of a fantasy. The Orks are capable of building devastating machines of warfare impossible to any other faction. Not to be underestimated by anyone within clubbing distance.

Chaos: The forces of Chaos, a hellish dimension with immense power capable of corrupting any who come in contact with it. Perhaps the biggest threat to the galaxy, the forces of Chaos will never yield until they can conquer humanity and crush the Imperium. Many forces of Humanity have been corrupted by Chaos, turning against their brethren and pledging themselves in service to the gods of Chaos. An army of unholy humans, aliens and demons with the incredible power to corrupt and destroy.

      <h3>BUILD YOUR ARMY | Learn about painting the miniatures</h3>
      <p>
        The way to play Warhammer 40k is to buy the official Games Workshop miniatures to assemble your chosen army. Each army has a set of rules and characters that may be used on the table top. Once your army is built you can take it to a local Warhammer scene and play the war simulation game against someone else and their army. Half the hobby of Warhammer consists of painting your miniatures. When they come out of the box they are just gray pieces that need to be assembled. You can paint these pieces to resemble the chosen colors and design of your faction, or you can add your own style to it. I have an army of Space Marines wielding swords and shields. I have painted them based on the design of my favorite Space Marine Chapter, the Black Templars. These marines have all black armor with a strong crusading Knight emphasis to their design. Learn about all the painting techniques to master the painting of miniatures, stylishly decorate your vast army, and express yourself on the tabletop.
