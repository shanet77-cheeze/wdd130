    <p>These are my friends back home in Washington. It was my freind's birthday. I'm the white guy on the far right.</p>
    <p>I am a transfer student but this is my first semester at BYU-I. My major is Economics.</p>
    <p>I like playing video games, the ones I've played recently are Resident Evil 4 and Elden Ring.</p>
    <p>I also like listening to music. Right now I like this band Basement a lot.</p>
    <p>I think being able to use HTML and creating websites is an amazing skill that you can use for pretty much anything. No matter what you do you can be able to make a website for your self or a friend. I'm looking forward to making websites for fun, and putting silly stuff on them.</p>
